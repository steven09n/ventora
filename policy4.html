<h1>Remote Assistance Delivery Process</h1>
  <p>At Ventora, LLC, all services are delivered 100% remotely using secure digital platforms and cloud-based tools. Our remote operations are structured to ensure reliability, accountability, and seamless communication regardless of the client’s location.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Workflow Overview</h2>
    <p>Once the agreement is confirmed, the service delivery process follows these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial Onboarding:</strong> Clients complete a brief intake form or call to confirm tools, points of contact, and priorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Task Intake:</strong> Tasks are submitted via email, shared documents, or project management platforms such as Trello or Asana.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution & Updates:</strong> Tasks are completed during business hours and updates are shared via email or collaborative dashboards.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Clients may provide real-time feedback, request revisions, or add new tasks through approved communication channels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not provide in-person meetings, physical deliverables, or on-site consultations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Tools & Platforms Used</h2>
    <p>To ensure smooth and secure collaboration, we use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Email, Zoom, Slack, Google Meet</li>
      <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Trello, Asana, ClickUp</li>
      <li><strong>File Sharing:</strong> Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox</li>
      <li><strong>Time Tracking & Logs:</strong> Harvest, Toggl (optional based on plan)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Custom platforms may be integrated based on client preferences, provided they meet our security standards.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Turnaround Times & Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Typical turnaround for standard tasks is 1–3 business days, depending on complexity, task volume, and the client’s responsiveness. Urgent tasks (same-day or 24-hour turnaround) must be pre-approved and may incur an expedited service fee.</p>
    <p>Tasks are scheduled in the order received and tracked based on available time under the active plan or retainer.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Business Hours & Availability</h2>
    <p>We operate Monday to Friday, 9 AM – 6 PM Mountain Time (MT). Clients are encouraged to submit tasks early in the day to allow maximum turnaround flexibility.</p>
    <p>Any tasks received after-hours or on weekends will be queued for the next business day unless prior arrangements are made.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Security & Professional Conduct</h2>
    <p>We maintain high standards of professionalism and security. All remote connections are encrypted. No client data is shared across projects or used for any purpose outside the scope of service.</p>
    <p>Client expectations and communication protocols are confirmed at the outset to ensure consistency and transparency throughout the engagement.</p>
