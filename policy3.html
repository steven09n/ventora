 <h1>Service Cancellation & Refund Terms</h1>
  <p>At Ventora, LLC, all services are prepaid, customized, and reserved in advance. Due to the nature of our work, we do not offer refunds under any circumstances. Instead, we provide clients with flexible rescheduling and time credit options to ensure service continuity.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. No Monetary Refunds</h2>
    <p>All payments are final. Once services are scheduled, time has been reserved and allocated specifically for the client. We do not provide cash refunds, partial refunds, or prorated reimbursements for any reason, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project cancellation by the client</li>
      <li>Unused service hours</li>
      <li>Failure to submit tasks or respond on time</li>
      <li>Dissatisfaction after service has been delivered</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This policy ensures fairness, prevents misuse, and allows us to commit fully to each client’s needs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Credit Issuance (Time-Based)</h2>
    <p>If a client provides at least 48 hours’ written notice prior to the scheduled start of a task or billing cycle, we may issue a time credit equal to the unused portion of their service.</p>
    <p>Time credits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are calculated based on the unused portion of prepaid hours</li>
      <li>Must be used within 120 days of the original purchase date</li>
      <li>Are non-transferable and non-redeemable for cash</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Credits may not be reissued after expiration or due to repeated cancellations.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Schedule Adjustments & Missed Tasks</h2>
    <p>Clients may request to reschedule meetings or task deliveries with a minimum of 24 hours' notice. Missed appointments or last-minute cancellations (under 24 hours) will be deducted from the client's active time balance.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Service Cancellation by the Company</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to cancel or pause services if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The client fails to provide needed information or access</li>
      <li>Communication is repeatedly delayed</li>
      <li>Behavior violates professional boundaries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In such cases, unused time may be credited.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Dispute</h2>
    <p>We aim to resolve issues professionally. Clients are encouraged to raise concerns in writing. However, no refund consideration will be made for dissatisfaction after service has begun or been delivered, or any time thereafter payment has been made.</p>
