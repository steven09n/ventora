  <h1>Service Agreement & Terms</h1>
  <p>At Ventora, LLC we deliver administrative and virtual assistant services to business clients exclusively through remote channels. All services are governed by this agreement, which defines the scope of work, payment structure, and mutual expectations to ensure clarity, efficiency, and professionalism throughout the engagement.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <p>Services offered may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calendar management and appointment scheduling</li>
      <li>Email and inbox organization</li>
      <li>Document preparation, formatting, and editing</li>
      <li>Data entry and database management</li>
      <li>Online research and reporting</li>
      <li>Bookkeeping and other administrative tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The precise scope will be defined in a written proposal or invoice for each engagement. Clients are responsible for providing accurate information and timely instructions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Payment & Billing Structure</h2>
    <p>Clients may choose from one of the following service models:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prepaid Retainer:</strong> Clients purchase a set number of hours in advance, typically for ongoing tasks. Hours are valid for 30 days unless otherwise agreed.</li>
      <li><strong>Fixed Monthly Package:</strong> A recurring monthly fee covering a defined scope of work. Ideal for predictable workloads.</li>
      <li><strong>Hourly Billing:</strong> For one-time or flexible task assignments. Billed in 15-minute increments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Invoices are due upon receipt unless otherwise specified. Work will not commence without confirmation of payment.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Agreement Process</h2>
    <p>Before starting services, clients receive a formal estimate, proposal, or onboarding document outlining:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scope of work</li>
      <li>Estimated time commitment</li>
      <li>Tools to be used</li>
      <li>Communication channels</li>
      <li>Delivery timelines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The client must confirm the agreement via email or signed document before services begin. A project kickoff will be scheduled upon confirmation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Communication & Availability</h2>
    <p>Services are provided during business hours (Monday to Friday, 9 AM–6 PM Mountain Time (MT), unless otherwise arranged). Communication occurs via:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana)</li>
      <li>Video conferencing (Zoom or Google Meet)</li>
      <li>Chat (Slack or Microsoft Teams)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Turnaround times vary based on task complexity and volume. Most tasks are completed within 1–3 business days unless otherwise arranged or recurrent.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Modifications & Additional Requests</h2>
    <p>Changes to the original agreement or additional tasks must be requested in writing. These will be billed separately if they exceed the original scope.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Termination & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate the engagement with five (5) business days’ written notice. Work completed up to that point will be invoiced. Disputes will be resolved through direct communication. If unresolved, both parties agree to mediation before pursuing legal action.</p>
